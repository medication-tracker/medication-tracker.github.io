## Project Description

In our design project, we have designed a medication tracker application that can be used by patients and their companions. Patients and their companions can add, track and edit medications. The application also has a reminder feature that reminds the patient to take the medication at the specified time. The application also has a feature that allows the patient to share the medication information with the doctor. The collected data from the application is intented to be used in a research project.
